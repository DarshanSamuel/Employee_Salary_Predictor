tkinter (built-in with Python)

# Details
This project implements an employee salary prediction system using machine learning techniques. It predicts an employeeâ€™s future salary based on inputs such as current salary, age, years of experience, education level, and job role. The model is trained using the XGBoost algorithm and integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter. The system allows users to input relevant parameters and select the duration after which the salary is to be predicted. It provides a visual representation of salary growth and includes input validation, error handling, and refresh functionality to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.
